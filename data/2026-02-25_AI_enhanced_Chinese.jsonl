In FSSL, data heterogeneity is a challenging issue, which exists both across clients and within clients. External heterogeneity refers to the data distribution discrepancy across different clients, while internal heterogeneity represents the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data within clients. Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server (external) and / or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client (internal). But, the former is hard to precisely fit the ideal global distribution via direct weights, and the latter results in fewer data participation into FL training. To this end, we propose a proxy-guided framework called ProxyFL that focuses on simultaneously mitigating external and internal heterogeneity via a unified proxy. I.e., we consider the learnable weights of classifier as proxy to simulate the category distribution both locally and globally. For external, we explicitly optimize global proxy against outliers instead of direct weights; for internal, we re-include the discarded samples into training by a positive-negative proxy pool to mitigate the impact of potentially-incorrect pseudo-labels.

When encountering an unfamiliar KG, such users face a distinct orientation challenge: they do not know what questions are possible, how the knowledge is structured, or how to begin exploration. This paper identifies and theorises this phenomenon as the Initial Exploration Problem (IEP). Drawing on theories from information behaviour and human-computer interaction, including ASK, exploratory search, information foraging, and cognitive load theory, we develop a conceptual framing of the IEP characterised by three interdependent barriers: scope uncertainty, ontology opacity, and query incapacity. We argue that these barriers converge at the moment of first contact, distinguishing the IEP from related concepts that presuppose an existing starting point or information goal. Analysing KG exploration interfaces at the level of interaction primitives, we suggest that many systems rely on epistemic assumptions that do not hold at first contact. This reveals a structural gap in the design space: the absence of interaction primitives for scope revelation, mechanisms that communicate what a KG contains without requiring users to formulate queries or interpret ontological structures. In articulating the IEP, this paper provides a theoretical lens for evaluating KG interfaces and for designing entry-point scaffolding that supports initial exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Moreover, we re-design the hybrid encoder with local attention, significantly enhancing both performance and inference speed. Based on these advancements, we present Le-DETR (\\textbf{L}ow-cost and \\textbf{E}fficient \\textbf{DE}tection \\textbf{TR}ansformer), which achieves a new \\textbf{SOTA} in real-time detection using only ImageNet1K and COCO2017 training datasets, saving about 80\\% images in pre-training stage compared with previous methods. We demonstrate that with well-designed, real-time DETR models can achieve strong performance without the need for complex and computationally expensive pretraining. Extensive experiments show that Le-DETR-M/L/X achieves \\textbf{52.9/54.3/55.1 mAP} on COCO Val2017 with \\textbf{4.45/5.01/6.68 ms} on an RTX4090. It surpasses YOLOv12-L/X by \\textbf{+0.6/-0.1 mAP} while achieving similar speed and \\textbf{+20\\%} speedup. Compared with DEIM-D-FINE, Le-DETR-M achieves \\textbf{+0.2 mAP} with slightly faster inference, and surpasses DEIM-D-FINE-L by \\textbf{+0.4 mAP} with only \\textbf{0.4 ms} additional latency.

This structural asymmetry widens a Measurability Gap between what agents can execute and what humans can afford to verify.

In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse.

To address these issues, we propose DropAnSH-GS, a novel anchor-based Dropout strategy. Rather than dropping Gaussians independently, our method randomly selects certain Gaussians as anchors and simultaneously removes their spatial neighbors. This effectively disrupts local redundancies near anchors and encourages the model to learn more robust, globally informed representations. Furthermore, we extend the Dropout to color attributes by randomly dropping higher-degree SH to concentrate appearance information in lower-degree SH. This strategy further mitigates overfitting and enables flexible post-training model compression via SH truncation. Experimental results demonstrate that DropAnSH-GS substantially outperforms existing Dropout methods with negligible computational overhead, and can be readily integrated into various 3DGS variants to enhance their performances.

In this work, we investigate whether EEG captures object representations across multiple hierarchical levels, and propose episodic analysis, in which a Machine Learning (ML) model is evaluated across various, yet related, classification tasks (episodes). Unlike prior episodic EEG studies that rely on fixed or randomly sampled classes of equal cardinality, we adopt hierarchy-aware episode sampling using WordNet to generate episodes with variable classes of diverse hierarchy. We also present the largest episodic framework in the EEG domain for detecting observed text from EEG signals in the PEERS dataset, comprising $931538$ EEG samples under $1610$ object labels, acquired from $264$ human participants (subjects) performing controlled cognitive tasks, enabling the study of neural dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and performance monitoring.

Recent vision-language methods incorporate textual semantics generated by large language models, but treat these descriptions as static class-level priors that are shared across all samples and lack sample-wise refinement. This limits both the diversity and precision of visual-semantic alignment, hindering generalization under limited supervision. To overcome this, we propose the stochastic MUlti-view Semantic Enhancement (MUSE), a framework that first refines semantic precision via sample-wise adaptation and then enhances semantic richness through retrieval-augmented multi-view generation. Specifically, MUSE introduces Sample-wise Fine-grained Semantic Enhancement (SFSE), which yields a fine-grained semantic prior for each sample through MoE-based adaptive visual-semantic interaction. Guided by this prior, Stochastic Multi-view Model Optimization (SMMO) constructs an LLM-generated knowledge base of diverse pathological descriptions per class, then retrieves and stochastically integrates multiple matched textual views during training. These dynamically selected texts serve as enriched semantic supervisions to stochastically optimize the vision-language model, promoting robustness and mitigating overfitting. Experiments on three benchmark WSI datasets show that MUSE consistently outperforms existing vision-language baselines in few-shot settings, demonstrating that effective few-shot pathology learning requires not only richer semantic sources but also their active and sample-aware semantic optimization.

At full body governance ($α=1$), closed-loop dynamics satisfy a self-consistency equation: cooperation is expressed as the reservoir's fixed point, not computed.

A dynamic sentinel generates a composite discomfort signal from the reservoir's own state, driving adaptive $α(t)$: near baseline during cooperation, rapidly dropping upon defection to activate cognitive retaliation.

We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST.

The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $β= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $β= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $β$ shifts from $0$ to $1$. We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Due to the lack of real-world pattern-image paired data, prior approaches fine-tune large vision language models (VLMs) on synthetic garment datasets generated by randomly sampling from a parametric garment model GarmentCode. However, these methods often struggle to generalize to in-the-wild images, fail to capture real-world correlations between garment parts, and are typically restricted to single-layer outfits. In contrast, we observe that VLMs are effective at describing garments in natural language, yet perform poorly when asked to directly regress GarmentCode parameters from images. To bridge this gap, we propose NGL (Natural Garment Language), a novel intermediate language that restructures GarmentCode into a representation more understandable to language models. Leveraging this language, we introduce NGL-Prompter, a training-free pipeline that queries large VLMs to extract structured garment parameters, which are then deterministically mapped to valid GarmentCode. We evaluate our method on the Dress4D, CloSe and a newly collected dataset of approximately 5,000 in-the-wild fashion images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard geometry metrics and is strongly preferred in both human and GPT-based perceptual evaluations compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, NGL-prompter can recover multi-layer outfits whereas competing methods focus mostly on single-layer garments, highlighting its strong generalization to real-world images even with occluded parts.

PromptCD constructs paired positive and negative guiding prompts for a target behavior and contrasts model responses-specifically token-level probability distributions in LLMs and visual attention patterns in VLMs-to reinforce desirable outcomes. This formulation extends contrastive decoding to a wide range of enhancement objectives and is applicable to both LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without additional training. For LLMs, experiments on the \"3H\" alignment objectives (helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements, indicating that post-trained models can achieve meaningful self-enhancement purely at test time.

To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations. Finally, addressing dynamics via architecture scaling, we propose UrbanFM, a minimalist self-attention architecture designed with limited inductive biases to autonomously learn dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from massive data.

First, low-active users and new users have limited search behavioral data, making it difficult to achieve effective personalized relevance preference modeling. Second, training data for ranking models predominantly come from high-relevance exposures, creating a distribution mismatch with the broader candidate space in coarse-ranking, leading to generalization bias.

We evaluated the feasibility of using innovative vision-language models (VLMs) to non-invasively estimate H and V from RGB video streams. Two multi-stage VLM-based pipelines were developed: a text-guided detection-only pipeline and a detection-plus-segmentation pipeline. Both pipelines used text-guided localization of task-relevant regions of interest, visual feature extraction from those regions, and transformer-based temporal regression to estimate H and V at the start and end of a lift. For a range of lifting tasks, estimation performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out validation across the two pipelines and seven camera view conditions. Results varied significantly across pipelines and camera view conditions, with the segmentation-based, multi-view pipeline consistently yielding the smallest errors, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 6-8 cm when estimating H and 5-8 cm when estimating V.

We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring.

More specifically, specific 3D objects are always captured in particular scenes with fixed camera poses, and hence lacks necessary diversity. Such tight entanglement induces the challenging issues of insufficient utilization and overfitting to uniform training data. To mitigate this, we propose an online object-scene-camera decomposition and recomposition data manipulation scheme to more efficiently exploit the training data. We first fully decompose training images into textured 3D object point models and background scenes in an efficient computation and storage manner. We then continuously recompose new training images in each epoch by inserting the 3D objects into the freespace of the background scenes, and rendering them with perturbed camera poses from textured 3D point representation. In this way, the refreshed training data in all epochs can cover the full spectrum of independent object, scene, and camera pose combinations. This scheme can serve as a plug-and-play component to boost M3OD models, working flexibly with both fully and sparsely supervised settings. In the sparsely-supervised setting, objects closest to the ego-camera for all instances are sparsely annotated. We then can flexibly increase the annotated objects to control annotation cost.

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses.

In response, a common proactive defense leverages fragile watermarks to detect, localize, or even recover manipulated regions. However, these methods always assume an adversary unaware of the embedded watermark, overlooking their inherent vulnerability to watermark removal attacks. Furthermore, this fragility is exacerbated in the commonly used dual-watermark strategy that adds a robust watermark for image ownership verification, where mutual interference and limited embedding capacity reduce the fragile watermark's effectiveness. To address the gap, we propose RecoverMark, a watermarking framework that achieves robust manipulation localization, content recovery, and ownership verification simultaneously. Our key insight is twofold. First, we exploit a critical real-world constraint: an adversary must preserve the background's semantic consistency to avoid visual detection, even if they apply global, imperceptible watermark removal attacks. Second, using the image's own content (face, in this paper) as the watermark enhances extraction robustness. Based on these insights, RecoverMark treats the protected face content itself as the watermark and embeds it into the surrounding background. By designing a robust two-stage training paradigm with carefully crafted distortion layers that simulate comprehensive potential attacks and a progressive training strategy, RecoverMark achieves a robust watermark embedding in no fragile manner for image manipulation localization, recovery, and image IP protection simultaneously.

In this paper, we show that the primary limitation of current approaches lies in their reliance on post-hoc alignment of independently reconstructed sessions, which is insufficient under large temporal appearance change. We address this limitation by enforcing cross-session correspondences directly within a joint SfM reconstruction. Our approach combines complementary handcrafted and learned visual features to robustly establish correspondences across large temporal gaps, enabling the reconstruction of a single coherent 3D model from imagery captured years apart, where standard independent and joint SfM pipelines break down. We evaluate our method on long-term coral reef datasets exhibiting significant real-world change, and demonstrate consistent joint reconstruction across sessions in cases where existing methods fail to produce coherent reconstructions. To ensure scalability to large datasets, we further restrict expensive learned feature matching to a small set of likely cross-session image pairs identified via visual place recognition, which reduces computational cost and improves alignment robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose BFA++, a dynamic token pruning framework designed specifically for VLA models.

This design enables efficient token selection while preserving essential visual cues, resulting in improved computational efficiency and higher manipulation success rates.

We extend TAM by incorporating trust, perceived enjoyment, and subjective norms as additional factors that capture social and affective influences and uncertainty around AI outputs. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we find perceived usefulness remains the strongest predictor of students' intention to use conversational AI. However, perceived ease of use does not exert a significant direct effect on behavioral intention once other factors are considered, operating instead indirectly through perceived usefulness. Trust and subjective norms significantly influence perceptions of usefulness, while perceived enjoyment exerts both a direct and indirect effect on usage intentions.

Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, while deep learning (DL) approaches, though accurate, remain vulnerable to sample quality variations and artifacts. Building on our earlier CNN-based framework (Beznik et al., 2020), we evaluated YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 for CFU detection; however, these achieved only 97.08 percent accuracy, insufficient for pharmaceutical-grade requirements. A custom Detectron2 model trained on GSK's dataset of over 50,000 Petri dish images achieved 99 percent detection rate with 2 percent false positives and 0.6 percent false negatives. Despite high validation accuracy, Detectron2 performance degrades on outlier cases including contaminated plates, plastic artifacts, or poor optical clarity. To address this, we developed a multi-agent framework combining DL with vision-language models (VLMs). The VLM agent first classifies plates as valid or invalid. For valid samples, both DL and VLM agents independently estimate colony counts. When predictions align within 5 percent, results are automatically recorded in Postgres and SAP; otherwise, samples are routed for expert review. Expert feedback enables continuous retraining and self-improvement. Initial DL-based automation reduced human verification by 50 percent across vaccine manufacturing sites. With VLM integration, this increased to 85 percent, delivering significant operational savings.

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors.

Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations.

HFM structures the transport via two key designs: 1) Centripetal hyperbolic alignment: It constructs a centripetal hierarchy by anchoring textual roots, which pushes visual leaves to the boundary to initialize orderly flows. 2) Path-decoupled objective: It acts as a ``semantic guardrail'' rigidly confining trajectories within isolated class-specific geodesic corridors via step-wise supervision. Furthermore, we devise an adaptive diameter-based stopping to prevent over-transportation into the crowded origin based on the intrinsic semantic scale.

Pruning techniques affirmed themselves as valid tools to extract sparse representations of neural networks parameters, carefully balancing between compression and preservation of information. However, a fundamental assumption behind pruning is that expendable weights should have small impact on the error of the network, while highly important weights should tend to have a larger influence on the inference. We argue that this idea could be generalized; what if a weight is not simply removed but also compensated with a perturbation of the adjacent bias, which does not contribute to the network sparsity? Our work introduces a novel pruning method in which the importance measure of each weight is computed considering the output behavior after an optimal perturbation of its adjacent bias, efficiently computable by automatic differentiation. These perturbations can be then applied directly after the removal of each weight, independently of each other.

Existing techniques for imputing missing values predominantly focus on known unknowns, such as missing or unavailable values of lab test results; most do not explicitly address situations where it is difficult to distinguish what is missing. For instance, a missing diagnosis code in an EHR could signify either that the patient has not been diagnosed with the condition or that a diagnosis was made, but not shared by a provider. Such situations fall into the paradigm of unknown unknowns. To address this challenge, we develop a general purpose algorithm for denoising data to recover unknown missing values in binary EHRs. We design a transformer-based denoising neural network where the output is thresholded adaptively to recover values in cases where we predict data are missing. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in denoising medical codes within a real EHR dataset compared to existing imputation approaches and leads to increased performance on downstream tasks using the denoised data.

Drawing on cognitive psychology, we identify (both theoretically and empirically) two mechanisms undermining LLM idea diversity. First, at the individual level, LLMs exhibit fixation just as humans do, where early outputs constrain subsequent ideation. Second, at the collective level, LLMs aggregate knowledge into a unified distribution rather than exhibiting the knowledge partitioning inherent to human populations, where each person occupies a distinct region of the knowledge space. Through four studies, we demonstrate that targeted prompting interventions can address each mechanism independently: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reduces fixation by encouraging structured reasoning (only in LLMs, not humans), while ordinary personas (versus \"creative entrepreneurs\" such as Steve Jobs) improve knowledge partitioning by serving as diverse sampling cues, anchoring generation in distinct regions of the semantic space.

We introduce a unified multi-task RL framework that bridges this gap by treating reference motion as a prior for behavioral shaping rather than a deployment-time constraint. A single goal-conditioned policy is trained jointly on two tasks that share the same observation and action spaces, but differ in their initialization schemes, command spaces, and reward structures: (i) a reference-guided imitation task in which reference trajectories define dense imitation rewards but are not provided as policy inputs, and (ii) a goal-conditioned generalization task in which goals are sampled independently of any reference and where rewards reflect only task success. By co-optimizing these objectives within a shared formulation, the policy acquires structured, human-like motor skills from dense reference supervision while learning to adapt these skills to novel goals and initial conditions. This is achieved without adversarial objectives, explicit trajectory tracking, phase variables, or reference-dependent inference. We evaluate the method on a challenging box-based parkour playground that demands diverse athletic behaviors (e.g., jumping and climbing), and show that the learned controller transfers beyond the reference distribution while preserving motion naturalness.

Common image priors promote solutions on the general image manifold, such as sparsity, smoothness, or score function. However, as these priors do not constrain the null-space component, they can bias the reconstruction. Thus, we aim to incorporate meaningful null-space information in the reconstruction framework. Inspired by smooth image representation on graphs, we propose Graph-Smooth Null-Space Representation (GSNR), a mechanism that imposes structure only into the invisible component. Particularly, given a graph Laplacian, we construct a null-restricted Laplacian that encodes similarity between neighboring pixels in the null-space signal, and we design a low-dimensional projection matrix from the $p$-smoothest spectral graph modes (lowest graph frequencies). This approach has strong theoretical and practical implications: i) improved convergence via a null-only graph regularizer, ii) better coverage, how much null-space variance is captured by $p$ modes, and iii) high predictability, how well these modes can be inferred from the measurements. GSNR is incorporated into well-known inverse problem solvers, e.g., PnP, DIP, and diffusion solvers, in four scenarios: image deblurring, compressed sensing, demosaicing, and image super-resolution, providing consistent improvement of up to 4.3 dB over baseline formulations and up to 1 dB compared with end-to-end learned models in terms of PSNR.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study the applicability of unsupervised probabilistic methods to efficiently identify rare events in multidimensional solar observations and optimize our computational resources to the study of these extreme phenomena. We introduce Inspectorch, an open-source framework that utilizes flow-based models: flexible density estimators capable of learning the multidimensional distribution of solar observations. Once optimized, it assigns a probability to each sample, allowing us to identify unusual events. We apply this approach by applying it to observations from the Hinode Spectro-Polarimeter, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager at Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter. We find that the algorithm assigns consistently lower probabilities to spectra that exhibit unusual features. For example, it identifies profiles with very strong Doppler shifts, uncommon broadening, and temporal dynamics associated with small-scale reconnection events, among others. As a result, Inspectorch demonstrates that density estimation using flow-based models offers a powerful approach to identifying rare events in large solar datasets.

We instead propose a framework designed from the ground up with these goals in mind, by trying to strike a middle ground between: i) convex primitive based approaches used by common robotics simulators (efficient but not differentiable), and ii) mollified vertex-face and edge-edge unsigned distance-based approaches used by barrier methods (differentiable but inefficient).

To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a sample-efficient RL framework with online expert correction for autonomous catheter steering in endovascular bifurcation navigation.

To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage framework (SCAR-UNet-GAT) for real-time robotic path planning. In the first stage, SCAR-UNet, a spatial-coordinate-attention-regularized U-Net, is employed for accurate coronary vessel segmentation. The integration of multi-level attention mechanisms enhances the delineation of thin, tortuous vessels and improves robustness against imaging noise. From the resulting binary masks, vessel centerlines and bifurcation points are extracted, and geometric descriptors (e.g., branch diameter, intersection angles) are fused with local DSA patches to construct node features. In the second stage, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) reasons over the vessel graph to identify anatomically consistent and clinically feasible trajectories, effectively distinguishing true bifurcations from projection-induced false crossings. On a clinical DSA dataset, SCAR-UNet achieved a Dice coefficient of 93.1%.

This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity while avoiding the drawbacks of uncontrolled random sampling, yielding inefficient exploration. In this paper, we propose CalibRL, a hybrid-policy RLVR framework that supports controllable exploration with expert guidance, enabled by two key mechanisms. First, a distribution-aware advantage weighting scales updates by group rareness to calibrate the distribution, therefore preserving exploration. Meanwhile, the asymmetric activation function (LeakyReLU) leverages the expert knowledge as a calibration baseline to moderate overconfident updates while preserving their corrective direction.

This paper introduces OpenPort Protocol (OPP), a governance-first specification for exposing application tools through a secure server-side gateway that is model- and runtime-neutral and can bind to existing tool ecosystems. OpenPort defines authorization-dependent discovery, stable response envelopes with machine-actionable \\texttt{agent.*} reason codes, and an authorization model combining integration credentials, scoped permissions, and ABAC-style policy constraints. For write operations, OpenPort specifies a risk-gated lifecycle that defaults to draft creation and human review, supports time-bounded auto-execution under explicit policy, and enforces high-risk safeguards including preflight impact binding and idempotency. To address time-of-check/time-of-use drift in delayed approval flows, OpenPort also specifies an optional State Witness profile that revalidates execution-time preconditions and fails closed on state mismatch. Operationally, the protocol requires admission control (rate limits/quotas) with stable 429 semantics and structured audit events across allow/deny/fail paths so that client recovery and incident analysis are deterministic.

While robotic actions are often framed as autonomous and efficient, we show that each successful delivery is in fact a distributed sociotechnical achievement--reliant on human labor, regulatory coordination, and social accommodations. We argue that delivery robots do not replace labor but reconfigure it--rendering some forms more visible (robotic performance) while obscuring others (human and institutional support).

Effective cooling of MOSFETs is therefore essential to prevent overheating and potential burnout. Determining the required velocity for the purpose of effective cooling is of importance but is an ill-posed inverse problem and difficult to solve using traditional methods. MOSFET consists of multiple layers with different thermal conductivities, including aluminum, pyrolytic graphite sheets (PGS), and stainless steel pipes containing flowing water. We propose an algorithm that employs sequential training of the MOSFET layers in PINNs. Mathematically, the sequential training method decouples the optimization of each layer by treating the parameters of other layers as constants during its training phase. This reduces the dimensionality of the optimization landscape, making it easier to find the global minimum for each layer's parameters and avoid poor local minima.

To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits.

CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them \"structure-centric\". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment.

Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception.

However, CiM's adoption for RAG is limited by a fundamental ``representation gap,'' as high-precision, high-dimension embeddings are incompatible with CiM's low-precision, low-dimension array constraints. This gap is compounded by the diversity of CiM implementations (e.g., SRAM, ReRAM, FeFET), each with unique designs (e.g., 2-bit cells, 512x512 arrays). Consequently, RAG data must be naively reshaped to fit each target implementation. Current data shaping methods handle dimension and precision disjointly, which degrades data fidelity.

Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect.

We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias.

A malicious prompt injected into a conversation can compromise later reasoning, trigger dangerous tool calls, or distort final outputs. Despite the centrality of such systems, we currently lack a principled semantic foundation for reasoning about their behaviour and safety. We address this gap by introducing an untyped call-by-value lambda calculus enriched with dynamic information-flow control and a small number of primitives for constructing prompt-response conversations. Our language includes a primitive that invokes an LLM: it serializes a value, sends it to the model as a prompt, and parses the response as a new term. This calculus faithfully represents planner loops and their vulnerabilities, including the mechanisms by which prompt injection alters subsequent computation. The semantics explicitly captures conversations, and so supports reasoning about defenses such as quarantined sub-conversations, isolation of generated code, and information-flow restrictions on what may influence an LLM call.

Twin-width is a natural complexity measure of matrices (and more general structures) that has recently emerged as a unifying concept with important algorithmic applications. While the twin-width of a matrix is invariant to re-ordering rows and columns, most of its algorithmic applications to date assume that the input is given in a certain canonical ordering that yields a bounded twin-width contraction sequence. In general, efficiently finding such a sequence -- even for an approximate twin-width value -- remains a central and elusive open question. In this paper we show that a binary $n \\times n$ matrix of twin-width $d$ can be preprocessed in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}_d(n^2)$ time, so that its product with any vector can be computed in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}_d(n)$ time. Notably, the twin-width of the input matrix need not be known and no particular ordering of its rows and columns is assumed. If a canonical ordering is available, i.e., if the input matrix is $d$-twin-ordered, then the runtime of preprocessing and matrix-vector products can be further reduced to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2+dn)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(dn)$. Consequently, we can multiply two $n \\times n$ matrices in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^2)$ time, when at least one of the matrices consists of 0/1 entries and has bounded twin-width. The results also extend to the case of bounded twin-width matrices with adversarial corruption.

While Transformers have enabled global interactions among input elements in medical imaging, current computational challenges hinder their deployment on common hardware. Models like (Swin)UNETR adapt the UNet architecture by incorporating (Swin)Transformer encoders, which process tokens that each represent small subvolumes ($8^3$ voxels) of the input. The Transformer attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which is tied to the cubic scaling of 3D input resolution. This work reconsiders the role of convolution and attention, introducing Token-UNets, a family of 3D segmentation models that can operate in constrained computational environments and time frames. To mitigate computational demands, our approach maintains the convolutional encoder of UNet-like models, and applies TokenLearner to 3D feature maps. This module pools a preset number of tokens from local and global structures. Our results show this tokenization effectively encodes task-relevant information, yielding naturally interpretable attention maps.

To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm.

While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow.

Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity.

The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models.

We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning.

In this work, we reformulate our cover song generation as a conditional generation, which simultaneously generates new vocals and accompaniment conditioned on the original vocal melody and text prompts. To this end, we present SongEcho, which leverages Instance-Adaptive Element-wise Linear Modulation (IA-EiLM), a framework that incorporates controllable generation by improving both conditioning injection mechanism and conditional representation.

Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods. It first compute the cross-document IDF weighting to down-weight attention on query-overlapping tokens that frequently appear across the candidate documents, reducing lexical bias and emphasizing distinctive terms. It then employs entropy-based regularization to mitigate over-concentrated attention, encouraging a more balanced distribution across informative tokens.

Due to the flexibility, neural implicit fields have succeeded in many research areas, including shape reconstruction, novel view image synthesis, and more recently, object pose estimation. Neural implicit fields enable learning dense correspondences between the camera space and the object's canonical space-including unobserved regions in camera space-significantly boosting object pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios like highly occluded objects and novel shapes. Despite progress, predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved camera-space regions remains challenging due to the lack of direct observational signals. This necessitates heavy reliance on the model's generalization ability, resulting in high uncertainty. Consequently, densely sampling points across the entire camera space may yield inaccurate estimations that hinder the learning process and compromise performance.

The SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network estimates point-level attributes with SO(3)-equivariance at arbitrary query locations, demonstrating superior performance compared to most existing baselines.

Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios.

For several decades, the best known upper bound was 2, which is achievable by standard techniques. Only very recently, Byrka, Grandoni, and Traub [FOCS 2024] showed that the integrality gap of BCR is strictly below 2.

Prevailing evaluation approaches, which measure only end-to-end task success, offer limited insight into how these failures arise or how effectively agents recover from them. To bridge this gap, we propose MAS-FIRE, a systematic framework for fault injection and reliability evaluation of MAS.

This tiered view enables fine-grained diagnosis of where and why systems succeed or fail. Our findings reveal that stronger foundation models do not uniformly improve robustness. We further show that architectural topology plays an equally decisive role, with iterative, closed-loop designs neutralizing over 40% of faults that cause catastrophic collapse in linear workflows.

Crucially, the model incorporates a cross-modal Mamba interaction module featuring a novel dynamic C-matrix swapping mechanism. By exchanging state-space parameters between visual and temporal streams, this design conditions the state evolution of one modality on the context of the other, enabling deep structural coupling with linear computational complexity, thus overcoming the limitations of shallow concatenation.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong potential in analyzing tampered images and generating interpretations. However, they still struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, exhibit low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation. To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning. Specifically, our approach introduces Forensic Continual Pre-training, an easy-to-hard curriculum that well prepares the MLLM for tampered text detection by harnessing the large-scale cheap data from natural image forensic and OCR tasks. During fine-tuning, we perform Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions to reduce annotation dependency and improve reasoning capabilities. At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment. Our TFR benchmark simultaneously addresses seven major limitations of existing benchmarks and enables robust evaluation under cross-style, cross-method, and cross-language conditions.

Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS.

A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization.

Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

To address this open issue, we propose UniMob, a unified human mobility generation model across cities.

We evaluate UniMob extensively using two real-world datasets covering five cities. Comprehensive experiments show that UniMob significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of over 30\\% across multiple evaluation metrics.

A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs.

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Drawing on institutional analysis and evolutionary cooperation theory, we introduce a formal inequality that specifies when reliance on AI yields positive expected cooperative value. The model makes explicit how governance conditions, system policy, and accountability regimes jointly determine whether cooperation is rational or structurally defective. From this formalization we derive a cooperation ecology framework with six design principles: reciprocity contracts, visible trust infrastructure, conditional cooperation modes, defection-mitigation mechanisms, narrative literacy against authority theatre, and an Earth-first sustainability constraint. We operationalize the framework through three policy artefacts: a Human-AI Cooperation Charter, a Defection Risk Register, and a Cooperation Readiness Audit.

However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference.

In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories.

We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebra's structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: (i) how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, (ii) how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and (iii) to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation.

Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input.

However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge.

Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover).

CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars. At the core of CountEx is a novel Discriminative Query Refinement module, which jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues by first identifying shared visual features, then isolating exclusion-specific patterns, and finally applying selective suppression to refine the counting query. To support systematic evaluation of fine-grained counting methods, we introduce CoCount, a benchmark comprising 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs.

In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility.

However, previous approaches using reflective planning to guide VLMs in correcting actions encounter significant limitations. These methods rely on inefficient and often inaccurate implicit learning of state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only a single greedy future, and suffer from substantial inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. This provides a more direct and fine-grained supervisory signal for robust decision-making. Our method explicitly models the advantage of an action plan, quantified by its reduction in distance to the goal, and uses a scalable critic to estimate. To address the stochastic nature of single-trajectory evaluation, we employ beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate them during decoding to model their expected long-term returns, leading to more robust action generation. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight, confidence-based trigger that allows for early exit when direct predictions are reliable, invoking reflection only when necessary.

Framing effects arise when surface-level formatting differences (e.g., capitalization or numeric presentation) increase false-positive error flags despite unchanged semantics. Anchoring and adjustment bias appears when expert cues shift participant decisions beyond parity, consistent with salience and availability effects. We also observe the representativeness heuristic: atypical but valid attribute combinations are frequently flagged as erroneous, and in entity matching tasks, surface similarity produces a substantial false-positive rate with high confidence. In data repair, participants show a robust preference for leaving values missing rather than imputing plausible values, consistent with omission bias. In contrast, automation-aligned switching under strong contradiction does not exceed a conservative rare-error tolerance threshold at the population level, indicating that deference to automated recommendations is limited in this setting. Across scenarios, bias patterns persist among technically experienced participants and across diverse workflow practices, suggesting that bias in data cleaning reflects general cognitive tendencies rather than lack of expertise.

Most existing AMoD research focuses on fleet control (matching, rebalancing, ridepooling) on a fixed road network and does not address the joint design of the service network and fleet capacity. In this paper, we formalize this strategic design problem as the Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Network Design Problem (AMoD-NDP), in which an operator selects an operation subnetwork and routes all passengers, subject to infrastructure and fleet constraints and route-level quality-of-service requirements. We propose a path-based mixed-integer formulation of the AMoD-NDP and develop a column-generation-based algorithm that scales to city-sized networks. The master problem optimizes over a restricted set of paths, while the pricing problem reduces to an elementary shortest path with resource constraints, solved exactly by a tailored label-correcting algorithm. The method provides an explicit certificate of the optimality gap and extends naturally to a robust counterpart under box uncertainty in travel times and demand. Using real-world data from Manhattan, New York City, we show that the framework produces stable and interpretable operation subnetworks, quantifies trade-offs between infrastructure investment and fleet time, and accommodates additional path-level constraints, such as limits on left turns as a proxy for operational risk.

In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In practice, even minor urban changes require substantial manual effort to redraw geospatial layouts, slowing the iterative planning and decision-making procedure. Motivated by recent advances in agentic systems and multimodal reasoning, we formulate urban renewal as a machine-executable task that iteratively modifies existing urban plans represented in structured geospatial formats. More specifically, we represent urban layouts using GeoJSON and decompose natural-language editing instructions into hierarchical geometric intents spanning polygon-, line-, and point-level operations. To coordinate interdependent edits across spatial elements and abstraction levels, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework that jointly performs multi-level planning and execution with explicit propagation of intermediate spatial constraints. We further introduce an iterative execution-validation mechanism that mitigates error accumulation and enforces global spatial consistency during multi-step editing. Extensive experiments across diverse urban editing scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency, robustness, correctness, and spatial validity over existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines.

This survey presents a structured analysis of agentic memory from both architectural and system perspectives. We first introduce a concise taxonomy of MAG systems based on four memory structures. Then, we analyze key pain points limiting current systems, including benchmark saturation effects, metric validity and judge sensitivity, backbone-dependent accuracy, and the latency and throughput overhead introduced by memory maintenance.
