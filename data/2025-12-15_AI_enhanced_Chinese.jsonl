However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了基于统计矩的高保真透射函数计算方法，改进了3D高斯点阵的渲染效果。", "motivation": "现有的3D高斯点阵技术依赖于简化的顺序相关alpha混合和密度积分的粗略近似，在处理复杂重叠半透明物体时存在限制。本文旨在提高其物理准确性和渲染质量。", "method": "通过引入基于统计矩的方法，对每个相机射线上贡献的所有3DGaussian进行像素级时刻分析，并重建连续透传函数以模拟光线在复杂介质中的衰减过程。", "result": "该方法避免了光线追踪或逐像素采样的需求，显著提升了重叠半透明物体的渲染质量和整体重建精度。", "conclusion": "本文提出的基于统计矩的方法有效解决了3D高斯点阵中光透射计算的问题，增强了物理准确性，并改善了复杂场景中的渲染效果。"}}

We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models.

Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset.

Biological neurons are stochastically interconnected, forming complex neural pathways that exhibit Neuron-Expandability, Pathway-Reusability, and Dynamic-Configurability. In this paper, we introduce a new SNN paradigm, named Cognition-aware SNN (CogniSNN), by incorporating Random Graph Architecture (RGA). Furthermore, we address the issues of network degradation and dimensional mismatch in deep pathways by introducing an improved pure spiking residual mechanism alongside an adaptive pooling strategy.

Although semantic change detection methods have attempted to address this by categorizing changes into predefined classes, these methods rely on rigid class definitions and fixed model architectures, making it difficult to mix datasets with different label sets or reuse models across tasks, as the output channels are tightly coupled with the number and type of semantic classes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in. However, training models for RCD is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of (I) \\textbf{RCDNet}, a cross-modal fusion network designed for referring change detection, and (II) \\textbf{RCDGen}, a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produces realistic post-change images and change maps for a specified category using only pre-change image, without relying on semantic segmentation masks and thereby significantly lowering the barrier to scalable data creation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our framework enables scalable and targeted change detection.

However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing.

We utilize a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from the driving video as control signals for animation generation. Such latents implicitly capture nuanced facial expression dynamics with identity and pose information disentangled, and they are efficiently injected into the video diffusion transformer through our proposed expression controller.

In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \\textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \\mathbfΣ_{HR} + \\mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\\times$--10$\\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data.

Large Action Models aim at extending Large Language Models to encompass the full perception, reasoning, and action cycle; however, they typically require substantially more comprehensive training and suffer from the same deficiencies in reliability.

Our experiments on a multi-modal robot demonstrate that Large Action Model intelligence does not require massive end-to-end training, but can be achieved by integrating efficient perception models with a logic-driven core.

While this is a well established concept for strings, in the context of tries the state-of-the-art regarding entropies is less developed. The standard trie worst-case entropy considers the set of tries with a fixed number of nodes and alphabet size. However, this approach does not consider the frequencies of the symbols in the trie, thus failing to capture the compressibility of tries with skewed character distributions. On the other hand, the label entropy [FOCS '05], proposed for node-labeled trees, does not take into account the tree topology, which has to be stored separately. In this paper, we introduce two new entropy measures for tries - worst-case and empirical - which overcome the two aforementioned limitations. Notably, our entropies satisfy similar properties of their string counterparts, thereby becoming very natural generalizations of the (simpler) string case. Indeed, our empirical entropy is closely related to the worst-case entropy and is reachable through a natural extension of arithmetic coding from strings to tries. Moreover we show that, similarly to the FM-index for strings [JACM '05], the XBWT of a trie can be compressed and efficiently indexed within our k-th order empirical entropy plus o(n) bits, with n being the number of nodes.

We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions.

We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines.

To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility.

This method reformulates evolutionary search as a Neural Unrolling process grounded in Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) fixed-point theory. First, L2E models a coupled dynamic system in which the inner loop enforces a strict contractive trajectory via a structured Mamba-based neural operator.

More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images.

Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage.

The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension.

Therefore, this paper develops a multi-mode underwater structured light 3D imaging system for pipeline detection (UW-SLD system) based on multi-source information fusion. First, a rapid distortion correction (FDC) method is employed for efficient underwater image rectification.

However, the process of transitioning from taxonomy to concrete test cases remains unstructured, and completeness is theoretical. This paper introduces a structured method of subdividing the ODD into manageable sections, termed micro-ODDs (mODDs), and deriving test cases with abstract object representations.

Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information.

Existing researches on flare removal have mainly focused on images, while the spatiotemporal characteristics of video flare remain largely unexplored. Video flare synthesis and removal pose significantly greater challenges than in image, owing to the complex and mutually independent motion of flare, light sources, and scene content. This motion independence further affects restoration performance, often resulting in flicker and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a physics-informed dynamic flare synthesis pipeline, which simulates light source motion using optical flow and models the temporal behaviors of both scattering and reflective flares. Meanwhile, we design a video flare removal network that employs an attention module to spatially suppress flare regions and incorporates a Mamba-based temporal modeling component to capture long range spatio-temporal dependencies.

First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos.

To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset.

However, each study tends to select different feature sets, making it difficult to establish a unified representation for the task. Moreover, such features are not intuitive for humans to perceive, as the distinction between bona fide and synthesized speech becomes increasingly subtle with the advancement of deepfake generation techniques. Emotion, on the other hand, remains a unique human attribute that current deepfake generator struggles to fully replicate, reflecting the gap toward true artificial general intelligence. Interestingly, many existing acoustic and semantic features have implicit correlations with emotion. For instance, speech features recognized by automatic speech recognition systems often varies naturally with emotional expression. Based on this insight, we propose a novel training framework that leverages emotion as a bridge between conventional deepfake features and emotion-oriented representations.

Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB.

Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level. To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion.

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

Most of the RGB-based navigation systems only guarantee coarse, meter-level accuracy, making them less suitable for the precise positioning phase of mobile manipulation. This gap prevents manipulation policies from operating within the distribution of their training demonstrations, resulting in frequent execution failures. We address this gap by introducing an object-centric imitation learning framework for last-meter navigation, enabling a quadruped mobile manipulator robot to achieve manipulation-ready positioning using only RGB observations from its onboard cameras. Our method conditions the navigation policy on three inputs: goal images, multi-view RGB observations from the onboard cameras, and a text prompt specifying the target object. A language-driven segmentation module and a spatial score-matrix decoder then supply explicit object grounding and relative pose reasoning. Using real-world data from a single object instance within a category, the system generalizes to unseen object instances across diverse environments with challenging lighting and background conditions. To comprehensively evaluate this, we introduce two metrics: an edge-alignment metric, which uses ground truth orientation, and an object-alignment metric, which evaluates how well the robot visually faces the target. Under these metrics, our policy achieves 73.47% success in edge-alignment and 96.94% success in object-alignment when positioning relative to unseen target objects. These results show that precise last-meter navigation can be achieved at a category-level without depth, LiDAR, or map priors, enabling a scalable pathway toward unified mobile manipulation.

Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "研究公平性约束的在线优化问题，提出FairOBD算法以平衡成本和公平性。", "motivation": "许多在线优化问题需要同时考虑公平性和操作平滑度，但至今未有方法兼顾二者。本文针对此难题提供解决方案。", "method": "提出FairOBD算法，通过引入辅助变量将长期公平成本分解为一系列在线成本，并以此调节在线行为以实现公平结果。", "result": "证明了FairOBD在考虑无限期问题时可以达到与离线最优参数化约束算法相媲美的最差情况渐近竞争比率。实验表明，在动态计算资源分配中，FairOBD能有效降低总的成本并促进公平性。", "conclusion": "通过引入新的方法来处理切换成本，证明了FairOBD在长期优化问题中的有效性，并展示了其相较于现有基线解决方案的优势。"}}

OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model.

However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars.

The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \\mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "该论文研究了一种新的点函数Derf，以替代传统归一化层，并在多个领域中表现出优于现有方法的性能。", "motivation": "通过引入Dynamic Tanh（DyT）证明了可以找到替代归一化层的方法后，该工作继续寻找更好的设计来进一步提高性能。", "method": "研究点函数特性如何影响训练和表现，并进行大规模搜索以发现更有效的设计。最终提出了Derf函数并验证其优越性。", "result": "在视觉、语音表示及DNA序列建模等多个领域中，Derf超越了LayerNorm、RMSNorm以及DyT的表现。", "conclusion": "该研究证明了通过改进点函数可以达到甚至超过现有归一化层的性能，并且其简单性和优越性使其成为无归一化Transformer架构的一个实用选择。"}}
