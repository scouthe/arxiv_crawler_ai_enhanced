Unlike human-driven Mobility-on-Demand (MoD), AMoD enables fully centralized fleet control, but it also requires appropriate infrastructure, so that vehicles can operate safely only on a suitably instrumented subnetwork of the roads. Most existing AMoD research focuses on fleet control (matching, rebalancing, ridepooling) on a fixed road network and does not address the joint design of the service network and fleet capacity. In this paper, we formalize this strategic design problem as the Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Network Design Problem (AMoD-NDP), in which an operator selects an operation subnetwork and routes all passengers, subject to infrastructure and fleet constraints and route-level quality-of-service requirements. We propose a path-based mixed-integer formulation of the AMoD-NDP and develop a column-generation-based algorithm that scales to city-sized networks. The master problem optimizes over a restricted set of paths, while the pricing problem reduces to an elementary shortest path with resource constraints, solved exactly by a tailored label-correcting algorithm. The method provides an explicit certificate of the optimality gap and extends naturally to a robust counterpart under box uncertainty in travel times and demand. Using real-world data from Manhattan, New York City, we show that the framework produces stable and interpretable operation subnetworks, quantifies trade-offs between infrastructure investment and fleet time, and accommodates additional path-level constraints, such as limits on left turns as a proxy for operational risk. These results illustrate how the proposed approach can support strategic planning and policy analysis for future AMoD deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns.

In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content.

In particular, we propose a safe and interpretable multimodal path planning method, CaPE (Code as Path Editor), which generates and updates path plans for an agent based on the environment and language communication from other agents. CaPE leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to synthesize a path editing program verified by a model-based planner, grounding communication to path plan updates in a safe and interpretable way. We evaluate our approach in diverse simulated and real-world scenarios, including multi-robot and human-robot cooperation in autonomous driving, household, and joint carrying tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPE can be integrated into different robotic systems as a plug-and-play module, greatly enhancing a robot's ability to align its plan to language communication from other robots or humans. We also show that the combination of the VLM-based path editing program synthesis and model-based planning safety enables robots to achieve open-ended cooperation while maintaining safety and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike prior intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), which largely function as adaptive and interactive problem sets with feedback and hints, conversational tutors hold the potential to simulate high-quality human tutoring by engaging with students' thoughts, questions, and misconceptions in real time. While some previous ITS, such as AutoTutor, could respond conversationally, they were expensive to author and lacked a full range of conversational ability. Generative AI has changed the capacity of ITS to engage conversationally. However, realizing the full potential of conversational tutors requires careful consideration of what research on human tutoring and ITS has already established, while also unpacking what new research will be needed. This paper synthesizes tenets of successful human tutoring, lessons learned from legacy ITS, and emerging work on conversational AI tutors. We use a keep, change, center, study framework for guiding the design of conversational tutoring. We argue that systems should keep proven methods from prior ITS, such as knowledge tracing and affect detection; change how tutoring is delivered by leveraging generative AI for dynamic content generation and dialogic scaffolding; and center opportunities for meaning-making, student agency, and granular diagnosis of reasoning. Finally, we identify areas requiring further study, including efficacy testing, student experience, and integration with human instruction. By synthesizing insights from human tutoring, legacy ITS, and emerging generative AI technologies, this paper outlines a research agenda for developing conversational tutors that are scalable, pedagogically effective, and responsive to the social and motivational dimensions of learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Because students seek assistance at moments of difficulty, conventional evaluation is confounded by self-selection and time-varying knowledge states. We address these challenges by integrating principled analytic sample construction with Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) to estimate latent mastery, followed by doubly robust estimation using Causal Forests. Applying this framework to over 5,000 middle-school mathematics tutoring sessions, we find that requesting human tutoring increases next-problem correctness by approximately 4 percentage points and accuracy on the subsequent skill encountered by approximately 3 percentage points, suggesting that the effects of tutoring have proximal transfer across knowledge components. This effect is robust to various forms of model specification and potential unmeasured confounders. Notably, these effects exhibit significant heterogeneity across sessions and students, with session-level effect estimates ranging from $-20.25pp$ to $+19.91pp$. Our follow-up analyses suggest that typical behavioral indicators, such as student talk time, do not consistently correlate with high-impact sessions. Furthermore, treatment effects are larger for students with lower prior mastery and slightly smaller for low-SES students.

Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL).

For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences.

This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning.

Contrary to existing vision-based control algorithms in the literature that regulate the robot's end effector pose, our proposed control algorithm regulates the robot's whole body configuration, enabling us to leverage its kinematic redundancy. Additionally, our model-based 2.5D shape visual servoing provides globally stable asymptotic convergence in the robot's 3D workspace compared to the closest works in the literature that report local minima. Unlike existing visual servoing algorithms in the literature, our approach does not require information from proprioceptive sensors, making it suitable for continuum manipulators without such capabilities. Instead, robot state is estimated from images acquired by an external camera that observes the robot's whole body shape and is also utilized to close the shape control loop. Traditionally, visual servoing schemes require an image of the robot at its reference pose to generate the reference features. In this work, we utilize an inverse kinematics solver to generate reference features for the desired robot configuration and do not require images of the robot at the reference. Experiments are performed on a multisection continuum manipulator demonstrating the controller's capability to regulate the robot's whole body shape while precisely positioning the robot's end effector. Results validate our controller's ability to regulate the shape of continuum robots while demonstrating a smooth transient response and a steady-state error within 1 mm.
