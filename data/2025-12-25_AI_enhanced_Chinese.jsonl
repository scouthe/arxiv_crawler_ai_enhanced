Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk.

Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries.

To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence.

Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames.

In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications.

Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions.

Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others.

Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain.

This technique immediately implies PTASs for the problems of finding a smallest k-edge-connected or k-vertex-connected spanning subgraph of a planar graph for arbitrary k.

In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions.

One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG.

With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability.

While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP.

In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种基于事件相机的光学流引导6自由度物体姿态跟踪方法。", "motivation": "传统相机在物体姿态跟踪中面临诸如运动模糊、传感器噪声、部分遮挡和光照变化等挑战。新兴仿生感光器，特别是事件相机，在动态范围和延迟方面具有优势，可以解决这些问题。", "method": "采用2D-3D混合特征提取策略检测事件与对象模型中的角点和边缘，精确表征物体运动；通过最大化时空窗口内的事件相关概率搜索角点的光学流，并在光学流引导下建立角点和边缘之间的关联；最后，通过最小化角点和边缘的距离迭代优化6自由度姿态以实现连续跟踪。", "result": "实验结果表明，在模拟和真实数据集上该方法相较于现有的基于事件的方法具有更高的精度和鲁棒性。", "conclusion": "本文提出了一种新的利用光学流指导的、基于事件相机的物体姿态跟踪算法，展示了其在准确度与鲁棒性上的优越性能。"}}

LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions.

Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution.

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints.

To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment.

Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed.

This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models.

Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG).

Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic).

By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks.

Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive \"thinking\" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception.

Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term \"internal RL\", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails.

We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It \"fails fast\" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and \"wins big\" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.
