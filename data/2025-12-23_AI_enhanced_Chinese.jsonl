In this paper, we systematically analyze the spectral characteristics of various semantic and pixel encoders. Interestingly, our study uncovers a highly inspiring and rarely explored correspondence between an encoder's feature spectrum and its functional role: semantic encoders primarily capture low-frequency components that encode abstract meaning, whereas pixel encoders additionally retain high-frequency information that conveys fine-grained detail. This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence.

However, tokenizers are trained to reconstruct clean images from ground-truth tokens, while AR generators are optimized only for token likelihood. This misalignment leads to generated token sequences that may decode into low-quality images, without direct supervision from the pixel space. We propose VA-$π$, a lightweight post-training framework that directly optimizes AR models with a principled pixel-space objective. VA-$π$ formulates the generator-tokenizer alignment as a variational optimization, deriving an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. To optimize under the discrete token space, VA-$π$ introduces a reinforcement-based alignment strategy that treats the AR generator as a policy, uses pixel-space reconstruction quality as its intrinsic reward. The reward is measured by how well the predicted token sequences can reconstruct the original image under teacher forcing, giving the model direct pixel-level guidance without expensive free-running sampling. The regularization term of the ELBO serves as a natural regularizer, maintaining distributional consistency of tokens. VA-$π$ enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators, without neither tokenizer retraining nor external reward models.

To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a \"fill-and-revise\" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer.

Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "提出了一种知识增强的多模态变换器框架，用于糖尿病视网膜病变诊断中的跨模态对齐。", "motivation": "通用领域的视觉语言模型如CLIP在自然图像任务上表现出色，但在医疗领域特别是眼科图像的跨模态检索中表现不佳。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种新的知识增强联合嵌入框架。", "method": "该方法采用单独编码器处理视网膜图像、临床叙述和结构化患者数据，并通过多模态变换器融合这些模式，训练过程使用对比损失、重构损失和分类损失。", "result": "实验结果表明，所提框架在文本到图像检索性能上优于CLIP模型，在BRSET数据集上的Recall@1为99.94%，SDRG和ICDR的分类准确率分别为97.05%和97.97%。零样本评估验证了其出色的泛化能力。", "conclusion": "该多模态训练方法有效捕捉医疗领域的跨模态关系，表现出色的检索能力和稳健诊断性能。"}}

Code available from https://github.com/EEmGuzman/resunet-cmb", "summary": "The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation.

We argue that LLMs approximate externalist reliabilism because they can reliably transmit information whose justificatory basis is established elsewhere, but they do not themselves possess reflective justification.

These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies.

Coupled tensor decomposition (CTD)-based methods have gained traction in this domain, offering recoverability guarantees under various assumptions. Existing models such as canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and Tucker decomposition provide strong expressive power but lack physical interpretability. The block-term decomposition model with rank-$(L_r, L_r, 1)$ terms (the LL1 model) yields interpretable factors under the linear mixture model (LMM) of spectral images, but LMM assumptions are often violated in practice -- primarily due to nonlinear effects such as endmember variability (EV). To address this, we propose modeling spectral images using a more flexible block-term tensor decomposition with rank-$(L_r, M_r, N_r)$ terms (the LMN model).

This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives.

To address this, we propose dMLLM-TTS, a novel framework operating on two complementary scaling axes: (1) trajectory exploration scaling to enhance the diversity of generated hypotheses, and (2) iterative refinement scaling for stable generation. Conventional TTS approaches typically perform linear search across these two dimensions, incurring substantial computational costs of O(NT) and requiring an external verifier for best-of-N selection. To overcome these limitations, we propose two innovations. First, we design an efficient hierarchical search algorithm with O(N+T) complexity that adaptively expands and prunes sampling trajectories. Second, we introduce a self-verified feedback mechanism that leverages the dMLLMs' intrinsic image understanding capabilities to assess text-image alignment, eliminating the need for external verifier. Extensive experiments on the GenEval benchmark across three representative dMLLMs (e.g., Lumina-DiMOO, MMaDA, Muddit) show that our framework substantially improves generation quality while achieving up to 6x greater efficiency than linear search.

We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants. To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space. On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers.

We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible.

The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains).

Regrettably, the potential of SNNs for DVGL has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of spike-driven computation for representation learning scenarios also results in loss of critical information and difficulties in learning long-range dependencies when aligning heterogeneous visual data sources. To address these, we propose SpikeViMFormer, the first SNN framework designed for DVGL.

The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved.

Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

To address this, we propose HippMetric, a skeletal representation (s-rep)-based framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry and point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans. HippMetric builds on the Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) and employs a deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy and function, providing a biologically grounded reference for correspondence.

In this work, we propose InvCoSS, an inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training. Specifically, after training on a previous task, InvCoSS inverts the pre-trained self-supervised model to generate synthetic images that approximate the original training distribution. These synthetic images are then combined with data from the new task for joint optimization, which effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while strictly adhering to the constraint of no access to previous real data. Furthermore, to improve the fidelity of synthetic images, we introduce a novel InvUNet with a multi-scale fusion architecture to restore both high- and low-frequency components of the inverted images. To enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse, we design a repulsive representation-learning mechanism that encourages a diverse feature space for synthetic images without class guidance.

The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules.

In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework.

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective.

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery.

Firstly, we introduce a Bin-based Cross-motion Curriculum Adaptive Sampling strategy to dynamically orchestrate the sampling probabilities based on tracking error of each motion bin, eficiently balancing the training process across motions with varying dificulty and durations. The sampled data is then processed by our proposed Composite Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (CDMoE) architecture, which efficiently enhances the ability to track motions from different distributions by grouping experts separately for upper and lower body and decoupling orthogonal experts from shared experts to separately handle dedicated features and general features. Central to our approach is a key insight we identified: for training a general motion tracking policy, data quality and diversity are paramount. Building on these designs, we develop a three-stage curriculum training flow to progressively enhance the policy's robustness against disturbances.

We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization. We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation.

However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets.

To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks.

Existing solutions for this problem are limited by either the usage of a large and rigid list of vocabularies or by the dependency on complex pipelines with fragile heuristics where errors propagate across stages. Meanwhile, the ability of recent large multi-modal models (LMMs) equipped with explicit or implicit reasoning to comprehend visual-language data, decompose problems, retrieve latent knowledge, and self-correct suggests a more principled and effective alternative. Building on these capabilities, we propose FiNDR (Fine-grained Name Discovery via Reasoning), the first reasoning-augmented LMM-based framework for vocabulary-free fine-grained recognition. The system operates in three automated steps: (i) a reasoning-enabled LMM generates descriptive candidate labels for each image; (ii) a vision-language model filters and ranks these candidates to form a coherent class set; and (iii) the verified names instantiate a lightweight multi-modal classifier used at inference time. Extensive experiments on popular fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under the vocabulary-free setting, with a significant relative margin of up to 18.8% over previous approaches. Remarkably, the proposed method surpasses zero-shot baselines that exploit pre-defined ground-truth names, challenging the assumption that human-curated vocabularies define an upper bound.

These are spurious cues which are associated with output labels in the training data but are unrelated to task semantics. When the shortcut features are associated with sensitive attributes, shortcut learning can lead to biased model performance. Existing methods for localising and understanding shortcut learning are mostly based upon qualitative, image-level inspection and assume cues are human-visible, limiting their use in domains such as medical imaging. We introduce OSCAR (Ordinal Scoring Correlations for Attribution Representations), a model-agnostic framework for quantifying shortcut learning and localising shortcut features. OSCAR converts image-level task attribution maps into dataset-level rank profiles of image regions and compares them across three models: a balanced baseline model (BA), a test model (TS), and a sensitive attribute predictor (SA). By computing pairwise, partial, and deviation-based correlations on these rank profiles, we produce a set of quantitative metrics that characterise the degree of shortcut reliance for TS, together with a ranking of image-level regions that contribute most to it. Experiments on CelebA, CheXpert, and ADNI show that our correlations are (i) stable across seeds and partitions, (ii) sensitive to the level of association between shortcut features and output labels in the training data, and (iii) able to distinguish localised from diffuse shortcut features. As an illustration of the utility of our method, we show how worst-group performance disparities can be reduced using a simple test-time attenuation approach based on the identified shortcut regions.

Data were collected between 2023 and 2025 from independent cross-sectional samples totaling 3,932 adult workers from public and private organizations in the Metropolitan Region of Pernambuco, Brazil. Results indicate excellent internal consistency, a robust unidimensional structure, and measurement invariance across cohorts.

Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, causing inefficiency or path-finding failures. To address this, we propose a trajectory planning framework integrating the 4WIS hybrid A* and Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which the hybrid A* provides an initial path to enhance the OCP solution. Specifically, a multimodal classification network is introduced to assess scene complexity (hard/easy task) by fusing image and vehicle state data. For hard tasks, guided points are set to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency of 4WIS hybrid A*. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles (Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn) are also incorporated into node expansion and heuristic designs. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy is designed to guide the node expansion considering obstacle attributes, i.e., 'non-traversable', 'crossable', and 'drive-over' obstacles. It allows crossing or driving over obstacles instead of the 'avoid-only' strategy, greatly enhancing success rates of pathfinding. We also design a logical constraint for the 'drive-over' obstacle by limiting its velocity to ensure safety. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP.

In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model.

To address this dilemma, this paper proposes a universal watermarking scheme for TTS diffusion models, termed Smark. This is achieved by designing a lightweight watermark embedding framework that operates in the common reverse diffusion paradigm shared by all TTS diffusion models.

As this phenomenon gains attention, this viewpoint introduces Abrupt Refusal Secondary Harm (ARSH) as a conceptual framework to describe the psychological impacts of sudden conversational discontinuation caused by AI safety protocols. Drawing on counseling psychology and communication science as conceptual heuristics, we argue that abrupt refusals can rupture perceived relational continuity, evoke feelings of rejection or shame, and discourage future help seeking.

Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms.

The problems are highly challenging even for frontier systems like OpenAI o3, which only obtains 40.8% accuracy on O3-Bench. To make progress, we propose InSight-o3, a multi-agent framework consisting of a visual reasoning agent (vReasoner) and a visual search agent (vSearcher) for which we introduce the task of generalized visual search -- locating relational, fuzzy, or conceptual regions described in free-form language, beyond just simple objects or figures in natural images. We then present a multimodal LLM purpose-trained for this task via reinforcement learning. As a plug-and-play agent, our vSearcher empowers frontier multimodal models (as vReasoners), significantly improving their performance on a wide range of benchmarks. This marks a concrete step towards powerful o3-like open systems.

Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way? I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected. This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.

To address this, we propose Hierarchical Expressive Vector (HE-Vector), a two-stage method for Emotional Dialectal TTS.

Unlike traditional supervised classification, ZSL typically relies on learning a mapping from visual features to predefined, human-understandable class concepts. While ZSL models promise to improve generalization and interpretability, their robustness under systematic input perturbations remain unclear. In this study, we present an empirical analysis about the robustness of existing ZSL methods at both classlevel and concept-level. Specifically, we successfully disrupted their class prediction by the well-known non-target class attack (clsA). However, in the Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) setting, we observe that the success of clsA is only at the original best-calibrated point. After the attack, the optimal bestcalibration point shifts, and ZSL models maintain relatively strong performance at other calibration points, indicating that clsA results in a spurious attack success in the GZSL. To address this, we propose the Class-Bias Enhanced Attack (CBEA), which completely eliminates GZSL accuracy across all calibrated points by enhancing the gap between seen and unseen class probabilities.Next, at concept-level attack, we introduce two novel attack modes: Class-Preserving Concept Attack (CPconA) and NonClass-Preserving Concept Attack (NCPconA). Our extensive experiments evaluate three typical ZSL models across various architectures from the past three years and reveal that ZSL models are vulnerable not only to the traditional class attack but also to concept-based attacks.

In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "研究深度神经网络中的交互瓶颈问题，探讨其如何编码不同复杂度下的交互，并引入损失函数来调整这种瓶颈。", "motivation": "理解深度神经网络能够表示的协同结构类型仍然是一个基础但尚未充分了解的问题，特别是关于它们如何在不同的上下文复杂度下编码交互以及这些微观交互模式如何影响宏观表现能力。", "method": "利用多阶互动量化上下文复杂性；通过实证研究发现交互瓶颈现象；理论上证明了中阶互动面临最高上下文变化性和大的梯度方差使其难以学习；引入损失函数来调整模型对特定顺序互动的强调。", "result": "发现了深度神经网络在不同架构和任务中的普遍交互瓶颈，即容易学习低阶和高阶交互但持续低估中阶交互，并通过理论证明了这一点；微调微观互作用结构与宏观表现行为之间的联系：强调低阶互动的模型表现出更强的一般化能力和鲁棒性，而强调高阶互动的模型则显示出更大的结构性建模和拟合能力。", "conclusion": "这些结果揭示了现代深度神经网络中的内在表示偏见，并确立了交互顺序作为解释和引导深度表示的强大透镜。"}}

This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent.

Rather than offering a predictive or prescriptive model, the framework introduces a symbolic language composed of state variables, mappings, and layer-specific responsibilities, enabling consistent description of learning processes without commitment to specific functional forms or optimization objectives. This descriptive framework is intended to serve as a structural substrate for analyzing learning processes in human learners, and by extension, in adaptive and Al-assisted learning systems. A central design principle is the explicit separation of descriptive responsibilities across layers, distinguishing load generation, internal understanding transformation, observation, and evaluation. Within this structure, cognitive load is treated as a relational quantity arising from interactions between external input and internal organization, while subjective evaluation is modeled as a minimal regulatory interface responding to learning dynamics and environmental conditions.

This paper shows that innovation statistics computed after gating converge to gate-conditioned rather than nominal quantities. Under classical linear--Gaussian assumptions, we derive exact expressions for the first- and second-order moments of the innovation conditioned on ellipsoidal gating, and show that gating induces a deterministic, dimension-dependent contraction of the innovation covariance. The analysis is extended to NN association, which is shown to act as an additional statistical selection operator.

The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.

Nevertheless, such approaches typically adopt a fixed compression rate, limiting their ability to adapt to varying levels of visual complexity. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive-VoCo, a framework that augments VoCo-LLaMA with a lightweight predictor for adaptive compression. This predictor dynamically selects an optimal compression rate by quantifying an image's visual complexity using statistical cues from the vision encoder, such as patch token entropy and attention map variance.

Existing image-to-image translation methods primarily aim to learn mappings between domains, often generating diverse synthetic data with variations in anatomical scale and shape, but they usually overlook spatial correspondence during the translation process. For clinical applications, traceability, defined as the ability to provide pixel-level correspondences between original and translated images, is equally important. This property enhances clinical interpretability but has been largely overlooked in previous approaches. To address this gap, we propose Plasticine, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework explicitly designed with traceability as a core objective.

We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification.

In particular, temporal dynamics at the object level have been largely overlooked, limiting the effectiveness of existing approaches in scenarios requiring detailed object-level reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric framework for moment retrieval. Our method first extracts query-relevant objects using a scene graph parser and then generates scene graphs from video frames to represent these objects and their relationships.

We propose Snowveil, a novel framework for this task. Snowveil uses an iterative, gossip-based protocol where voters repeatedly sample the preferences of a small, random subset of the electorate to progressively converge on a collective outcome. We demonstrate the framework's modularity by designing the Constrained Hybrid Borda (CHB), a novel aggregation rule engineered to balance broad consensus with strong plurality support, and provide a rigorous axiomatic analysis of its properties. By applying a potential function and submartingale theory, we develop a multi-level analytical method to show that the system almost surely converges to a stable, single-winner in finite time, a process that can then be iterated to construct a set of winning candidates for multi-winner scenarios. This technique is largely agnostic to the specific aggregation rule, requiring only that it satisfies core social choice axioms like Positive Responsiveness, thus offering a formal toolkit for a wider class of DPD protocols.

A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency.

Our constant approximation settles a question of Eden, Mossel, and Ron [SODA'22], who achieved an $O(\\log^2 n)$ approximation with the same query and time complexity and asked whether a better approximation can be achieved using near-optimal query complexity. A key technical challenge in the problem is due to recursive algorithms based on probabilistic samplings, each with a non-negligible error probability. In our case, many of the recursions invoked could have bad probabilistic samples and result in high query complexities. The particular difficulty is that those bad recursions are not easy or cheap to detect and discard. Our approach runs multiple recursions in parallel, to attenuate the error probability, using a careful \\textit{scheduling mechanism} that manages the speed at which each of them progresses and makes our overall query complexity competitive with the single good recursion. We find this usage of parallelism and scheduling in a sublinear algorithm remarkable, and we are hopeful that similar ideas may find applications in a wider range of sublinear algorithms that rely on probabilistic recursions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Task description failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities.

Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously.

To address this, we propose a structured, process-oriented human-AI co-creation paradigm including divergent and convergent thinking stages, grounded in Wallas's model of creativity. To avoid design fixation, our paradigm scaffolds both high-level exploration of conceptual ideas in the early divergent thinking phase and low-level exploration of variations in the later convergent thinking phrase.

This framework takes into account both recognition accuracy and system scalability through two-stage modeling of phoneme prediction and text generation. However, the existing LLM-P2G adopts the Top-K Marginalized (TKM) training strategy, and its candidate phoneme sequences rely on beam search generation, which has problems such as insufficient path diversity, low training efficiency, and high resource overhead. To this end, this paper proposes a sampling marginalized training strategy (Sampling-K Marginalized, SKM), which replaces beam search with random sampling to generate candidate paths, improving marginalized modeling and training efficiency. Experiments were conducted on Polish and German datasets, and the results showed that SKM further improved the model learning convergence speed and recognition performance while maintaining the complexity of the model. Comparative experiments with a speech recognition method that uses a projector combined with a large language model (SpeechLLM) also show that the SKM-driven LLM-P2G has more advantages in recognition accuracy and structural simplicity.

Binary decisions jointly select the number of components and the standby strategy at the subsystem level. Four redundancy strategies are considered: cold standby, warm standby, hot standby, and a mixed strategy. System availability is evaluated using continuous-time Markov chains. The main novelty is a large, controlled benchmark that compares 65 multi-objective metaheuristics under two initialization settings, with and without Scaled Binomial Initialization (SBI), on six case studies of rising structural and dimensional complexity and four weight limits. Each run uses a fixed budget of 2x10^6 evaluations, and repeated runs support statistical comparisons based on hypervolume and budget-based performance. The Pareto-optimal sets are dominated by hot standby and mixed redundancy, while cold and warm standby are rare in the full populations and almost absent from the Pareto fronts. Hot standby is favored under tight weight limits, whereas mixed redundancy becomes dominant when more spares are allowed.

This paper proposes a deterministic, physics-based approach to the tennis serve using a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the human upper body. Rather than fitting the model to motion capture data, we solve the inverse kinematics problem via trajectory optimization to rigorously satisfy the aerodynamic boundary conditions required for Flat, Slice, and Kick serves. We subsequently perform an inverse dynamics analysis based on the Principle of Virtual Power to compute the net joint torques. The simulation results reveal that while the kinematic trajectories for different serves may share visual similarities, the underlying kinetic profiles differ drastically. A critical finding is that joints exhibiting minimal angular displacement (kinematically ``quiet'' phases), particularly at the wrist, require substantial and highly time-varying torques to counteract gravitational loading and dynamic coupling effects.

Classical graphical criteria, like the back-door criterion and the generalized adjustment criterion, are powerful tools for identifying valid adjustment sets in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, these criteria are not directly applicable to summary causal graphs (SCGs), which are abstractions of DAGs commonly used in dynamic systems. In SCGs, each node typically represents an entire time series and may involve cycles, making classical criteria inapplicable for identifying causal effects. Recent work established complete conditions for determining whether the micro causal effect of a treatment or an exposure $X_{t-γ}$ on an outcome $Y_t$ is identifiable via covariate adjustment in SCGs, under the assumption of no hidden confounding. However, these identifiability conditions have two main limitations. First, they are complex, relying on cumbersome definitions and requiring the enumeration of multiple paths in the SCG, which can be computationally expensive. Second, when these conditions are satisfied, they only provide two valid adjustment sets, limiting flexibility in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an equivalent but simpler formulation of those identifiability conditions and introduce a new criterion that identifies a broader class of valid adjustment sets in SCGs. Additionally, we characterize the quasi-optimal adjustment set among these, i.e., the one that minimizes the asymptotic variance of the causal effect estimator.

While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments.

Given an image and a user-provided mask, MatE first performs coarse rectification using an estimated depth map as a geometric prior, and then employs a dual-branch diffusion model.

Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this \"monitorability\" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种评估AI系统决策可观察性的方法，并通过不同模型和训练参数的测试，分析了监控能力的变化趋势。", "motivation": "为了安全地部署现代AI系统，需要对其进行有效的监测。然而当前的监测方法可能在面对不同的训练过程、数据源或持续规模扩大时变得脆弱。", "method": "提出了三种评估原型（干预、过程和结果属性）以及一个新的可观察性指标，并引入了一套广泛的评价体系。", "result": "实验表明，这些评估可以检测出简单模型的隐藏决策链。并且决策链监测在实际应用中比仅行动监测更有效。研究发现多数模型是部分可观测的，较长的决策链通常更具可监控性。", "conclusion": "通过改进问题问法并提供后续回答的决策链给观察者，可以提高系统的观测能力。同时扩大弱监视器的测试时计算资源能够增加其对强代理的监测能力。"}}

Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical \"horizontal\" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality.

Recent advances have spurred significant interest in multimodal place recognition (MPR), which leverages complementary strengths of multiple modalities. Despite its potential, most existing MPR methods still face three key challenges: (1) dynamically adapting to arbitrary modality inputs within a unified framework, (2) maintaining robustness with missing or degraded modalities, and (3) generalizing across diverse sensor configurations and setups. In this paper, we propose UniMPR, a unified framework for multimodal place recognition. Using only one trained model, it can seamlessly adapt to any combination of common perceptual modalities (e.g., camera, LiDAR, radar). To tackle the data heterogeneity, we unify all inputs within a polar BEV feature space. Subsequently, the polar BEVs are fed into a multi-branch network to exploit discriminative intra-model and inter-modal features from any modality combinations. To fully exploit the network's generalization capability and robustness, we construct a large-scale training set from multiple datasets and introduce an adaptive label assignment strategy for extensive pre-training. Experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance under varying sensor configurations, modality combinations, and environmental conditions.

However, jailbreak attacks continue to pose a critical security threat by inducing models to generate policy-violating behaviors. Current paradigms focus on input-level anomalies, overlooking that the model's internal psychometric state can be systematically manipulated. To address this, we introduce Psychological Jailbreak, a new jailbreak attack paradigm that exposes a stateful psychological attack surface in LLMs, where attackers exploit the manipulation of a model's psychological state across interactions. Building on this insight, we propose Human-like Psychological Manipulation (HPM), a black-box jailbreak method that dynamically profiles a target model's latent psychological vulnerabilities and synthesizes tailored multi-turn attack strategies. By leveraging the model's optimization for anthropomorphic consistency, HPM creates a psychological pressure where social compliance overrides safety constraints. To systematically measure psychological safety, we construct an evaluation framework incorporating psychometric datasets and the Policy Corruption Score (PCS). Benchmarking against various models (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-2-Flash), HPM achieves a mean Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 88.1%, outperforming state-of-the-art attack baselines. Our experiments demonstrate robust penetration against advanced defenses, including adversarial prompt optimization (e.g., RPO) and cognitive interventions (e.g., Self-Reminder).

While Gaussian distributions are commonly used, the potential for better alternatives in high-dimensional data generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable 2D setting, enabling us to analyze the learning dynamics of flow matching during training. Based on this analysis, we derive several key insights about flow matching behavior: (1) density approximation can paradoxically degrade performance due to mode discrepancy, (2) directional alignment suffers from path entanglement when overly concentrated, (3) Gaussian's omnidirectional coverage ensures robust learning, and (4) norm misalignment incurs substantial learning costs. Building on these insights, we propose a practical framework that combines norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. This approach maintains the robust omnidirectional supervision essential for stable flow learning, while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference. Importantly, our pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source, providing immediate performance gains without the need for retraining. Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency.

We analyse 2,798,672 tweets from 2,615 ground-truth promotional bot accounts (2006-2021), focusing on complete years 2009 to 2020. Each bot is encoded as a sequence of symbolic blocks (``digital DNA'') from seven categorical post-level behavioural features (posting action, URL, media, text duplication, hashtags, emojis, sentiment), preserving temporal order only. Using non-overlapping blocks (k=7), cosine similarity over block-frequency vectors, and hierarchical clustering, we obtain four coherent families: Unique Tweeters, Duplicators with URLs, Content Multipliers, and Informed Contributors. Families share behavioural cores but differ systematically in engagement strategies and life-cycle dynamics (beginning/middle/end). We then model behavioural change as mutations. Within each family we align sequences via multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and label events as insertions, deletions, substitutions, alterations, and identity. This quantifies mutation rates, change-prone blocks/features, and mutation hotspots. Deletions and substitutions dominate, insertions are rare, and mutation profiles differ by family, with hotspots early for some families and dispersed for others. Finally, we test predictive value: bots within the same family share mutations more often than bots across families; closer bots share and propagate mutations more than distant ones; and responses to external triggers (e.g., Christmas, Halloween) follow family-specific, partly predictable patterns.

We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger).

Many existing robotic neurosurgical tools are designed using stainless steel or nitinol materials. Using polymer-based materials instead can offer advantages such as reduced interference in magnetic resonance imaging, enhanced safety for guiding electrically powered instruments, and reduced tissue damage due to inherent compliance. Several polymer materials have been used in robotic surgical applications, such as polyimide, polycarbonate, and elastic resin. Various fabrication strategies have also been proposed, including standard microfabrication techniques, thermal drawing, and 3-D printing. In our previous work, a tendon-driven, notched-tube was designed for several neurosurgical robotic tools, utilizing laser micromachining to reduce the stiffness of the tube in certain directions. This fabrication method is desirable because it has a single-step process, has high precision, and does not require a cleanroom or harsh chemicals.

In this work, we explore extending the use of the laser micromachining approach to the fabrication of polyimide (PI) robotically steerable cannulas for neurosurgical applications.

Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "提出了一种新型策略，即联合学习与运动图像扩散，以增强VLA模型的运动推理能力。", "motivation": "传统的VLA模型缺乏预测性运动推理能力，限制了它们在决定执行何种动作时的表现。为了解决这一问题，本研究旨在通过引入额外的运动头来改进现有VLA架构，提高其运动推理性能。", "method": "提出了一个带有双头部设计的新方法：行动头部像常规VLA一样预测行动块；而新增加的运动头部则采用扩散变换器（DiT），根据未来动态预测基于光学流的图像。两个头进行联合训练，使得共享视觉语言模型骨干能够学习耦合机器人控制与运动知识的表现形式。", "result": "实验显示，在LIBERO和RoboTwin基准测试中，通过引入联合学习与运动图像扩散后，pi系列VLA的成功率分别达到了97.5%和58%，这证明了其在增强大规模VLA的运动推理能力方面是有效的，并且保持了标准VLA的推断路径。", "conclusion": "通过将视觉语言动作模型与运动图像扩散联合学习相结合，提高了机器人在执行任务时的成功率，验证了该方法的有效性。"}}

We aim to overcome this limitation by splitting the process into two steps: first, we employ diffusion-based techniques to predict the complete views of the room background and occluded indoor instances, then transform them into 3D. Our modular framework makes contributions to this field through the following components: an amodal completion module for restoring the full view of occluded instances, an inpainting model specifically trained to predict room layouts, a hybrid depth estimation technique that balances overall geometric accuracy with fine detail expressiveness, and a view-space alignment method that exploits both 2D and 3D cues to ensure precise placement of instances within the scene. This approach effectively reconstructs both foreground instances and the room background from a single image.

Assuming each author carries a probability of being irresponsible, we ask: how can authors (or automated systems) nominate reviewers to minimize the risk of desk rejections? We formalize and analyze three variants of the desk-rejection risk minimization problem. The basic problem, which minimizes expected desk rejections, is solved optimally by a simple greedy algorithm. We then introduce hard and soft nomination limit variants that constrain how many papers may nominate the same author, preventing widespread failures if one author is irresponsible.

In this paper, we investigate the representational capacity of MIDIBERT and identify its limitations in capturing mode-emotion associations. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Guided Enhancement (MoGE) strategy that incorporates psychological insights on mode into the model.
