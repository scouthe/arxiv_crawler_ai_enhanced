Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks.

However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free.

The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases.

This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers.

Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability.

While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant \"popularity direction\" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations.

Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts.

Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "提出了一种基于自适应双重加权引力的点云去噪方法，以提高高精度、边界保持和实时性能。", "motivation": "现有的点云去噪技术在追求高准确度时牺牲了计算效率，或者为了提升处理速度而忽略了结构细节的保留。此研究旨在解决这些问题。", "method": "首先利用八叉树进行全局点云的空间划分以实现并行加速；其次，在每个叶子节点中使用自适应体素占用统计和kNN密度估计来快速去除明显的孤立噪音点，从而减少候选集；最后通过构建结合了密度权重与自适应距离权重的引力评分函数精细区分噪音点和物体点。", "result": "实验表明该方法在F1、PSNR及CD等指标上均优于现有方法，并且单帧处理时间也有所降低。", "conclusion": "所提出的方法能够在多种噪声条件下实现高精度去噪，具有良好的鲁棒性和实时性能。"}}

These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images.

This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility.

This relaxation is crucial in various real-world applications such as link prediction, community detection, and social network analysis. Although the problems of enumerating maximal $k$-defective cliques and searching a maximum $k$-defective clique have been extensively studied, existing algorithms suffer from limitations such as the combinatorial explosion of small partial solutions and sub-optimal search spaces. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clique-first branch-and-bound framework that first generates cliques and then adds missing edges. Furthermore, we introduce a new pivoting technique that achieves a search space size of $\\mathcal{O}(3^{\\frac{n}{3}} \\cdot n^k)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. We prove that the worst-case number of maximal $k$-defective cliques is $Ω(3^{\\frac{n}{3}} \\cdot n^k)$ when $k$ is a constant, establishing that our algorithm's search space is worst-case optimal. Leveraging the diameter-two property of defective cliques, we further reduce the search space size to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot 3^{\\fracδ{3}} \\cdot (δΔ)^k)$, where $δ$ is the degeneracy and $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. We also propose an efficient framework for maximum $k$-defective clique search based on our branch-and-bound, together with practical techniques to reduce the search space.

We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation.

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone.

Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens.

However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning.

Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states.

However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR).

Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $ω$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(ω\\log T + (\\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states.

Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled.

By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了AgriRegion框架，该框架旨在解决农业领域大型语言模型提供非事实性或区域不适用的建议的问题。", "motivation": "在农业领域，通用的大规模语言模型容易产生上下文幻觉，提供的建议可能因土壤、气候和地方规定差异而变得不准确。为此，作者设计了一种新的检索增强生成框架AgriRegion。", "method": "AgriRegion引入了一个地理元数据注入层以及优先考虑区域的重新排名机制，通过限制知识库为经过验证的地方农业推广服务，并在检索过程中施加地理位置约束来实现。", "result": "实验表明，在与最先进的LLM系统相比时，AgriRegion能够将幻觉减少10-20%，并显著提高信任评分。", "conclusion": "AgriRegion提供了一种有效的解决方案，以确保农业建议的准确性，并通过一个包含160个领域特定问题的新基准数据集进一步验证了其效果。"}}

Here we investigate the associations between dark traits, online toxicity, and the socio-linguistic characteristics of online user activity. To explore this relationship, we developed a Web application that integrates validated psychological questionnaires from Amazon Mechanical Turk users to their Reddit activity data. This allowed collecting nearly 57K Reddit comments, including 2.2M tokens and 152.7K sentences from 114 users, that we systematically represent through 224 linguistic and behavioral features. We then examined their relationship to questionnaire-based trait measures via multiple correlation analyses. Among our findings is that dark traits primarily influence the production rather than the perception of online incivility. Sadistic and psychopathic tendencies are most strongly associated with overtly toxic language, whereas other dark dispositions manifest more subtly, often eluding simple textual proxies. Self-reported engagement in hostile behavior mirrors actual online activity, while existing hand-crafted textual proxies for dark triad traits show limited correspondence with our validated measures. Finally, bright and dark traits interact in nuanced ways, with extraversion reducing trolling tendencies and conscientiousness showing modest associations with entitlement and callousness.

Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data.

Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning.

However, its core paradigm of mapping one sequence to one structure may only be appropriate for single-fold proteins with one stable conformation. Metamorphic proteins, which can adopt multiple distinct conformations, have conformational diversity that cannot be adequately modeled by AlphaFold2. Hence, classifying whether a given protein is metamorphic or single-fold remains a critical challenge for both laboratory experiments and computational methods. To address this challenge, we developed a novel classification framework by re-purposing AlphaFold2 to generate conformational ensembles via a multiple sequence alignment sampling method.

Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies. We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues.
